Hi! I'm David Asensio Cañas from Girona, Spain. I have been working as PHP and JavaScript developer since July 2014 at __[KoobinEvent S.L.](http://www.koobinevent.com/en/home.html){:target="_blank"}__ and I'm studying my third year of computer engineering degree at Open University of Catalonia. In the past, on my own free time I made a few projects at home by hobby and also with academical purposes. One of the projects which I'm most proud of is my humanoid robot that I made during the last year of my secondary school. This project was the first programmed thing I made, it was built using an Arduino UNO and was programmed in C++. With it I won a few awards and my work was __[published by the University of Vic](http://secundaria.uvic.cat/inici.php?ref=1103&id=treballs){:target="_blank"}__.

In my spare time I like listening to music, watching films and reading programming-related books or collaborating with open-source projects. I strongly believe in open-source and I think that it motivates people and companies to produce better software and to share what they learn with others.

Looking for a great web developer to do some freelance work for you? Check out my __[résumé]({{ '/resume' | prepend: site.baseurl }})__ and __[get in touch](mailto:david.asensio@icloud.com)__.
