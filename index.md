Hi! I'm David Asensio Cañas from Girona. I have been working as a full-stack web developer since July 2014 to now at __[KoobinEvent S.L.](http://www.koobinevent.com/en/home.html){:target="_blank"}__ and I'm studying a computer engineering degree at Open University of Catalonia. In the past, I have no worked in other companies but I made a few projects at home by hobby and also with academical purposes. One of the projects for which I'm most proud of is my humanoid robot that I made the last year of my secondary school, this project was the first programmed thing I made, it was build using an Arduino UNO, a self-made Arduino-compatible shield to power feed the 10 servo motors needed to move the robot and was programmed in C++. With it I won a few awards and my work was __[published by the University of Vic](http://secundaria.uvic.cat/inici.php?ref=1103&id=treballs){:target="_blank"}__.

In my spare time I like listening music, watching films and reading programming-related books or collaborating with open-source projects. I strongly believe in open-source and I think that it motivates people and companies to write better software and to share what they learn with others.

Looking for a great web developer to do some freelance work for you? Check out my résumé and get in touch.
