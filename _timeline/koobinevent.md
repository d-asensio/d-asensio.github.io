As a full-stack developer, I have used different programming languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Java, C++, etc. and also a bunch of tools like Jira, Zendesk, PHPStorm, Git, between many others. Some of the most remarkable tasks I have done during this period are: Developing new functionalities, fixing issues, research on new technologies and evaluate how they fit in the application and providing technical assistance to end users. All of these miscellaneous activities have given me a lot of experience about how to proceed in front of problems and technical challenges.
